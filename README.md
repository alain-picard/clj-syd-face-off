# the-great-face-off

Two men.

emacs vs cursive!

osx vs linux!

compojure vs pedestal!

Bald vs Bald!!!

Yes, it's...  =The great face-off!!!=


## Getting Started

1. Start the application according to your preferred tooling poison
2. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see: `Hello World!`
3. Do the challenges below while live coding!
4. Take a drink everytime you lose (or win, what the heck!) a challenge!
5. Take challenge requests from the audience!
6. Help your fellow clojurians to make sensible tooling choices.


## This repo:

This repo was created by doing a
   lein new pedestal-service my-service

and adding the dependencies required to do the compojure tooling separately.

There are two =-main= entry points, one for pedestal, in the-great-face-off/server.clj
and one in the-great-face-off/ring.clj

The rest is all scaffolding; the code is written while U watch!
